<!-- *Final project*

The final project is your chance to apply what you've learned about web development in this class and build a project you can show your peers, instructors, and perhaps even potential employers.

Use all of the combined skills you've learned to make a project that will be your first shot at a portfolio piece.

You should try using Git + Github, to track issues, suggest feature enhancements and ideas, and iterate over your in-progress software. 
Keep track of your progress using Git. 
Make at least 6-10 commits as your project progresses. 
You don't need to make a commit for every single minor change, but instead for each set of changes that adds to your website, or "feature". Also a commit before almost any code is written, your "initial commit". 
This isn't a requirement, but it's good practice to use version control when working on any project.


The requirements are:

- Create a proposal for your project and have it approved by Nick
- Make it responsive! Have a desktop version and a mobile version at the very least. If you have time try and make a tablet version.
- Add at least one type of jQuery function to every page of your site.
- Make the code clean! Keep your HTML, CSS and JavaScript properly indented. -->
