			<!-- BLOG INTRO  -->
					
			<div class="row" id="intro">
				<p>The following blog mixes personal experiences and analysis about Dutch culture, and is an example of my writing skills. From the SEO perspective, I seek to rank among subjects related to life in Amsterdam and Dutch culture, while the target audience are expats living in the city or people abroad interested in knowing more about the Dutch culture.</p>

				<h1>Dutch Elections 2017: The Results</h1>
				<h4>Posted: March 16th, 2017<h4>

				<p>  The elections have passed and you might have a lot of questions about what’s next. First, you might need to read my two previous posts about the system and the political parties, in order to have a better idea on how all works. Besides the result, what comes next is reaching the magic number of 76 seats to form a majority, which will be most likely headed by the current Minister President Rutte of the VVD (liberals).</p>

				<p>The results show, in my opinion, two different important lessons: first and foremost, Dutch people didn’t get seduced by populism and didn’t crown the xenophobe PVV party of Mr Wilders – which is still the second biggest party, growing 4 seats in comparison with the 2012 elections – but what I believe is the most remarkable lesson of all, is that the GroenLinks party headed by Jesse Klaver was the party with the most growth in this election – winning 10 seats, entering for the first time the major leagues.</p>

				<p>Why this growth of the GreenLeft is so important and entails one of the most important messages of this election? Because it shows that a big portion of society wanted to give a clear message to move ahead, to think about the environment, to be open to refugees, and to believe in the EU, besides criticising its policies of spending cuts. In my opinion, this shows a big message for embracing diversity and rejecting hate.</p>

				<p>Jesse Klaver is the face of the new Europe: born and bred in the Netherlands, his father is from Moroccan descent and his mother is half Indonesian – a former Dutch colony. Above all, he openly campaigned for an open arms policy for the refugees amidst a huge discussion against them. Independently of the nickname “Jessiah” I do think he represents mostly the new generations of voters, and helped to give them someone to believe in, and a way of making a statement about what is the way this society has to follow.</p>

				<p>Another really interesting fact is that participation in the election reached an astonishing 82% of the people with the right to vote – in a country where elections are not compulsory, and democracy failing in many countries, Dutch were conscious enough to realise they had to be part of this decision.</p>

				<p>What comes next? The formation of a coalition and a government, reaching a majority of 76 seats in the Second Chamber. Following the long Dutch tradition of being solution oriented, what is most likely to happen is that the current Minister President keeps his job – the VVD, even losing 8 seats is still the most voted party – entering in coalition with D66 (centre), CDA (Christian Democrats, centre right) and GroenLinks. In any case, it is all a game of numbers and agreeing on specific policies, and this could take some time – even months – until the final agreement is reached.</p>

				<p>In the meantime, the current government will keep running the everyday tasks, not starting any big changes, though the fact that Rutte won the elections gives him enough political legitimacy to have some initiative.</p>

				<p>The unfortunate big loser of this election was the PvdA, the Labour Party, which shares the government with the VVD since 2012, and payed with 29 seats for having sustained a lot of the liberal policies of the last 4 years. I think personally that their biggest mistake was not realising they needed a leader capable of create enthusiasm and hope, and most of those voters went instead to GroenLinks and D66.</p>

				<p>We have now to wait and see how this all will be channelled into a government pact for the next 4 years, but all in all, the main issue here is that the Netherlands chose for stability, rejected populism, and said that we need to care about people and the environment, not bad among a wave that until a few months ago, following Brexit and the election of Trump in the US, seemed unstoppable.</p>
